# CS454 Game development

Legend of Zelda game for course CS454 in C++

FOR COMPILING ANYTHING:
  all headers of Engine src will be in the CS454/Engine/Src/Headers/ so anyone can include them by "header.h"
  and to compile just add -I CS454/Engine/Src/Headers/ at the end 


g++ CS454/UnitTests/UnitTest1Media/main.cpp CS454/Engine/Src/Tiles/Parser/TileParser.cpp -I CS454/Engine/Src/Headers/
